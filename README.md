# Aws_ml_platform_design
== Requirements

The AWS-based ML Platform must address the following needs:

=== Must-Have
1. Support end-to-end ML lifecycle:
   - Data ingestion and preprocessing.
   - Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Model deployment for inference.
2. Allow collaboration among 15-20 users on shared datasets and models.
3. Provide secure access and resource isolation for multiple users or projects.
4. Ensure scalability to handle varying workloads (e.g., training jobs, batch inference).
5. Optimize for cost-efficiency, leveraging AWS managed services where possible.
6. Provide monitoring and logging for both system performance and ML workflows.
7. Enforce strong security measures, including IAM policies and VPC configurations.

=== Should-Have
1. Automation for common MLOps tasks, like CI/CD for ML pipelines.
2. Integration with external data sources (e.g., S3 buckets, RDS databases, or APIs).
3. Customizable compute resources for diverse workloads (e.g., GPU for training, CPU for inference).

=== Could-Have
1. Support for AutoML capabilities to streamline model development.
2. A user-friendly UI for non-technical users to launch training or inference jobs.

=== Won’t-Have
1. Support for large-scale production workloads beyond 20 users or massive datasets.
2. Complex multi-cloud setups (AWS-only for simplicity and cost reasons).


== Method

To build the AWS-based ML Platform, the following architecture and components are proposed:

=== Architecture Overview
The platform will leverage AWS managed services to provide scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions for ML workflows. The design is modular, supporting the following features:
- Data management
- Compute for ML training and inference
- User collaboration
- Monitoring and logging
- Secure access control

=== AWS Services Used
1. **Data Management**:
   - **Amazon S3**: Centralized data lake for storing raw, processed, and feature-engineered data.
   - **Amazon RDS**: Structured database for metadata, feature storage, or smaller datasets.

2. **Compute**:
   - **Amazon SageMaker**:
     - Managed training jobs with customizable instance types (CPU, GPU).
     - Model deployment with SageMaker Endpoints.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Lightweight serverless functions for data preprocessing or simple inference tasks.

3. **Collaboration & Development**:
   - **AWS Cloud9**: Cloud-based IDE for users to write code and run experiments.
   - **Amazon Cognito**: Authentication and user management.

4. **MLOps & Monitoring**:
   - **SageMaker Pipelines**: Automate ML workflows (training, evaluation, deployment).
   - **Amazon CloudWatch**: Centralized monitoring for resource usage and ML workflow logs.

5. **Access Control**:
   - **IAM Roles & Policies**: Define user permissions and resource isolation.
   - **VPC**: Secure network configuration.

=== Database Schema
For structured data in RDS, the schema can include:
- **Users Table**: User metadata, roles, and permissions.
- **Projects Table**: ML project metadata, owner, and status.
- **Model Metadata Table**: Details of trained models (versioning, location in S3).
- **Logs Table**: Execution logs for auditing.

| Table: Users       |
|--------------------|
| id (PK)            |
| name               |
| email              |
| role               |
| project_access     |

| Table: Models      |
|--------------------|
| id (PK)            |
| project_id (FK)    |
| model_name         |
| version            |
| s3_location        |

=== Key Algorithms
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use AWS Lambda or SageMaker Processing Jobs for batch transformations.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Leverage SageMaker’s built-in algorithms or custom training scripts.
3. **Inference**:
   - Deploy real-time or batch inference pipelines using SageMaker Endpoints.
  

== Implementation

The following steps outline how to implement the AWS ML Platform:

=== Step 1: Set Up AWS Resources
1. **Data Layer**:
   - Create an S3 bucket to serve as the central data lake.
     - Set up appropriate folder structures (e.g., `raw/`, `processed/`, `models/`).
     - Apply bucket policies to control access.
   - Set up an Amazon RDS database instance with the defined schema for metadata storage.
2. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - Define roles for users and services with least-privilege principles.
   - Assign permissions for S3, SageMaker, and RDS access.

=== Step 2: Develop User Access and Collaboration
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Configure Amazon Cognito to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and role-based access.
   - Integrate with IAM for secure resource access.
2. **Development Environment**:
   - Set up AWS Cloud9 IDEs for each user or group.

=== Step 3: Configure SageMaker
1. **Training**:
   - Create SageMaker training jobs with instance types based on workload (e.g., GPU for large models).
   - Store training scripts in S3 and set up lifecycle configurations for experiments.
2. **Inference**:
   - Deploy trained models to SageMaker Endpoints for real-time inference.
   - Set up batch inference jobs for large datasets.

=== Step 4: Automate ML Pipelines
1. Use SageMaker Pipelines to orchestrate workflows:
   - Include steps for data preprocessing, training, model evaluation, and deployment.
   - Save pipeline configurations in source control (e.g., CodeCommit or GitHub).
2. Set up triggers for pipeline execution (e.g., S3 data upload or scheduled jobs).

=== Step 5: Implement Monitoring and Logging
1. Configure CloudWatch for:
   - System performance metrics (e.g., training instance usage).
   - SageMaker logs (training, inference).
2. Set up alarms for critical thresholds (e.g., training failures, endpoint downtime).

=== Step 6: Optimize Costs
1. Use SageMaker Spot Instances for non-critical training jobs.
2. Monitor costs via AWS Cost Explorer and adjust configurations accordingly.

=== Step 7: Test the Platform
1. Perform end-to-end tests for:
   - Data ingestion, preprocessing, and storage.
   - Model training and deployment.
   - User access and resource isolation.
2. Address any security, performance, or functionality gaps.
